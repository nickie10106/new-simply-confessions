<h3>What is the MBTI Test?</h3>

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI Test) is an introspective self-report questionnaire that aimed to indicate differing psychological preferences in how people perceive the world around them and make decisions.

It was conceived by  Katherine Cook Briggs and her daughter, Isabel Briggs-Myers, who deduced that humans experience their environment through four primary psychological functions - sensation, intuition, feeling and thinking - and that out of the four, one function would inevitably dominate.

Working off  the conceptual theory proposed by Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, the mother-daughter duo eventually created the MBTI test which would divide all individuals  into 16 categories.

<h3>Uses through the years</h3>

Before the rise of the modern technological era, the test was most commonly used in the business sector as means to distinguish an individual's aptitude for a job. Many universities would ask their students to complete the questionnaire and tabulate their scores to distinguish what jobs would be best suited for them.

<h3>The Appeal</h3>
In recent years, the MBTI test has joined the ranks of the Hogwarts Sorting Quiz and Astrological signs and has <mark>found popularity amongst Millenials and Gen Z online.</mark>

These days, most do the test as a form of intraspective reflection. It has also been used as a means to group oneself into a community - similar to the houses in the Harry Potter sorting quiz. This usually allows one to find more like-minded individuals and provides a euphoric form of comfort that there are many others who share similar views as you.

The 16personalities site even encourages this through forums and accounts that link to the result of one's tests so that like-minded individuals can learn more about each other.

<h3>Same Person... Different Result...</h3>
Be that as it may, the test has faced many criticism. One of which is poor validity. Although there are a substantial amount of people who claim to have gotten the same result every time they attempted the MBTI, there have been a higher percentage who receive ever-changing results.

However, poor validity comes as no surprise since it is a self-report questionnaire. <mark>All self-report questionnaires pose an inherent issue of self-bias.</mark>

Many have heard the phrase 'No one knows me better than myself'. With that said, it is a universal fact that most people are (to a certain degree) blind to their own faults. Most people are quick to push blame onto others or claim that they are stress-resistant when they are not. They usually <mark>over-estimate their own strengths while attempting to downplay their weaknesses.</mark> These lead to inaccuracies in the quiz and will often lead people to get skewed results.

Aside from validity, some have also cited that the quiz creates a <mark>self-fulfilling prophecy</mark>. Similar to the way character quizzes or astrological signs impacted Gen Z, the MBTI's results instills a sense of self in those who take it.

Many who take it believe that the results are a way to rationalise their personality traits and <mark>simplify their flaws and strengths</mark> as simply just 'because they are a certain personality type'. Many attempt to use the test as a replacement for conducting a true reflection on their inner personalities. This means that they are likely to <mark>dismiss things like their background and environment which are not accounted for in the test.</mark>

With all that said, the test still holds many truths. If taken ideally and honestly, the test can help one to understand themselves better and help one to find a community amongst other similar individuals.

<h3>So... Just Dumb Fun?</h3>
Unfortunately, yes. The MBTI is just another means of passing time and possibly finding a community or maybe even a fun way to calculate your compatibility with your loved ones.

Although the test does hold substantial theories, the human psyche is much more complicated than any test could fathom. As such, it is almost impossible to categorise humans into just 16 categories.

Still, there is no denying that MBTI test helps people in many ways. It can be used to help writers better understand their characters' world view or maybe even understand more about others around you. The test does hold merits but it is just important for those who take it to understand that the results are not gospel.

It is much better to just take most things as a pinch of salt!
