<h3>What is the MBTI Test?</h3>
![Myers Briggs - 16 Personality](/images/posts/2019-08-07/1.jpg)
According to the book by the creator of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI Test), it is an introspective self-report questionnaire that aims to indicate differing psychological presferences in how people perceive the world around them and make decisions.

Working off the conceptual theory proposed by Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, Katherine Cook Briggs and her daughter, Isabel Briggs Myers, deduced that humans experience their environment through four primary psychological functions - sensation, intuition, feeling and thinking - and that out of the four, one function would inevitably dominate.

The mother-daughter duo hypothesised that all individuals could be divided into 16 categories(refer to 16 Personality site for the list).  

<h3>Uses through the years</h3>
Before the rise of the modern technological era, the test was most commonly used in the business sector as means to distinguish an individual's potential for a job. Many universities would ask their students to complete the questionairre and tabulate their scores to distinguish what jobs would be best suited for them.

Although the test has exhibited significant scientific sucesses, it is still considered pseudo science and has been noted by its poor validity (unreliable because the same person could get different results).
