<h3>What is the MBTI Test?</h3>
![Myers Briggs - 16 Personality](/images/posts/2019-08-07/1.jpg)
According to the book by the creator of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI Test), it is an introspective self-report questionnaire that aims to indicate differing psychological presferences in how people perceive the world around them and make decisions.

Working off the conceptual theory proposed by Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, Katherine Cook Briggs and her daughter, Isabel Briggs Myers, deduced that humans experience their environment through four primary psychological functions - sensation, intuition, feeling and thinking - and that out of the four, one function would inevitably dominate.

The mother-daughter duo hypothesised that all individuals could be divided into 16 categories(refer to 16 Personality site for the list).  

<h3>Uses through the years</h3>
Before the rise of the modern technological era, the test was most commonly used in the business sector as means to distinguish an individual's potential for a job. Many universities would ask their students to complete the questionnaire and tabulate their scores to distinguish what jobs would be best suited for them.

Although the test has exhibited significant scientific successes, it is still considered pseudo science and has been noted for its poor validity because the same person could get different results.

<h3>The Appeal</h3>
In recent years, the MBTI test has joined the ranks of the Hogwarts Sorting Quiz and Astrological signs and has found popularity amongst Millenials and Gen Z online.

These days, most do the test as a form of intraspective reflection. It has also been used as a means to group oneself into a community. Similar to the houses in the Harry Potter sorting quiz. This usually allows one to find more like-minded individuals and provides a euphoric form of comfort that there are many others who share similar views as you.

The 16personalities site even encourages this through forums and accounts that link to the result of one's tests so that like-minded individuals can learn more about each other.

<h3>Does it Work</h3>
Ah yes- we have finally approached the real question. Does the MBTI test work as well as it claims? The answer is unexpectedly divisive.

Although the MBTI test has many merits: it is free for all to take, it has a large array of results and most of the readings are fairly accurate, it is still a self-report questionnaire.

All self-report questionnaires poses an inherent issue in validity. Many have heard the phrase 'No one knows me better than myself'. And, although that is fairly accurate, there are many questions in the MBTI that pose the issue of self-bias.

It is not difficult to come to terms with the fact that most people are (to a certain degree) blind to their own faults. Most people are quick to push blame onto others or claim that they are stress-resistant when they are not. They usually over-estimate their own strengths and attempt to downplay their weaknesses. These lead to inaccuracies in the quiz and will often lead people to get skewed results.

Aside from those problems, the quiz also creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. Similar to the way character quizzes or Astrological signs impacted Gen Z, the MBTI's results instill a sense of self in those who take it. Many who take it believe that the results are a way to rationalise their personality traits and simplify their flaws and strengths as simply just 'because they are a certain personality type'.

Much more alarmingly,

With all that said, the test still holds many truths. If taken ideally and honestly, the test can help one to understand themselves better and help one to find a community amongst other similar individuals.
